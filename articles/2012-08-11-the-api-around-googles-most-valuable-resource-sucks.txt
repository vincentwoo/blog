title: The API around Google's most valuable resource sucks
date: 11/08/2012

> Disclosure: I recently worked for Google for about a year. It was alright.

Recently, Vic Gundotra of Google+ fame made a bold statement. He
[proclaimed](https://plus.google.com/107117483540235115863/posts/EstNjiL2uon)
that the lack of write API access to Google+ is born not out of lack of
foresight, planning, or even bandwidth, but out of trepidation, caution, and the
desire to do right by developers.

This is raw, barely refined bullshit ~(and I regret not being able to respond to
the thread with a pithier snarky comment). The truth is simpler: Google is
full-stop terrible at APIs.

As a case study, let's examine what I had to do in order to use the most
powerful collection of user-generated data that Google makes available to
developers: a user's [contact list][1]. People who work for consumer-facing web
companies probably know how deeply important having a user's email address is
for marketing. Despite being invented before I was born, email has yet to be
outmoded as the most effective way to push content to users on demand.

Email is huge, and each GMail user's contact list is a treasure trove of
potential customers. Recently here at [Everlane][2], we thought it might be a
good idea to have a button a user could hit to view a list of their GMail
contacts with portraits, select some of them, and then have us send those users
an invitation email. Simple, obvious stuff to want to do, right?

Well, let's hit the [getting started page][3] of the contacts API documentation.
Reading closely seems to reveal that there might already be a library for doing
what we want, which is really nothing more than getting a bunch of names, faces,
and emails. Those geniuses at Google *have* to have something already made for
this, right? We head over to the [libraries and samples page][4]. Cool, a
[javascript library][5]! This could be easy! *Nope*, they seem to support
everything but what we need. The Google+ read API doesn't seem to have a good
way to grab emails, either.

That's fine, we're pretty decent engineers and we can call the Contacts API on
our own. We register our application with the [API Console][6] and start reading
about OAuth. Google provides for a [few authorization schemes][7]. We probably
want the one titled ["Client-side Applications"][8], which saves us the trouble
of having our application server be aware of any auth tokens.















> Lastly, we're always on the lookout for talented developers who are interested
in the fashion space here at [Everlane][2]. If that sounds like you and you want
