title: misc toys
date: 03/16/2012

I've put a couple toys on my site that I haven't bothered documenting.

One is a toy canvas simulating a [bunch of colored balls in bouncing around](/google.html)
in the shape of the Google logo (I made it before joining Google).

The other is a nifty page that will load a [tumblr user's 100 longest posts](/js/tumblr.html).
It's all done client side, querying the old tumblr v1 API.
