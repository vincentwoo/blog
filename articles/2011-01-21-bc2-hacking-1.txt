Here's a quick youtube of some of the ballistic aimbot capabilities of a
hack that I am developing for [Bad Company 2](http://www.battlefieldbadcompany2.com).

Video has been obsoleted, see the [new post](/2011/01/24/gustav) for the new one.

The physics and realtime estimation involved is definitely the most 
interesting part of both the hack and the game itself. DICE did a pretty 
good job with the Frostbite engine. I'll admit I got some help trying to 
simplify the equations of aiming a projectile affected by gravity in 3D 
at a moving target. In loose terms, my approach is to simplify the 
"easy" case of aiming a projectile at a stationary target by collapsing 
the plane parallel to the ground into one dimension, since gravity only 
acts in the "Y" dimension. This is trivial, and comes easily with the 
intuition that the yaw (think side-to-side aiming) does not depend on 
the speed of the bullet or gravity. This leaves us with an equation of 
the form 

at^4 + bt^2 + c = 0 

which is easily solved. We then use this t to advance the target, and 
repeat the previous steps until the discrepancy between steps becomes 
tolerably small.
