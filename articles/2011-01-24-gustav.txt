The Gustav is a closed source C++ hack for [Battlefield: Bad Company 
2](http://battlefieldbadcompany2.com). It incorporates realtime physics 
simulation to determine potential targets, as well as unique D3D hooking 
to provide visual cues for the user in the game world itself.

It has taken me about three months of tinkering in my time off to put 
together and I am more or less satisfied with what it has taught me 
about physics and reverse engineering, which are two subjects that are 
very easy to unlearn without practice.

I have written up a couple pieces of interest encountered while 
developing the Gustav, namely [how to draw in 3D within the game world 
while respecting Z-depth][1] and a [short primer on how to write a 
tree-recursive menu][2], the latter of which will probably be nothing 
new to any experienced dev.
