I recently wrote a short piece about how a YC-funded cryptocurrency startup lost \$46M of its customers funds by investing it all in what was effectively a ponzi scheme.

You can read the piece on [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/terra-luna-cryptocurrency-crash-stablegains-2022-6) ([archived](https://archive.ph/nD50M)) as well as [listen to some interviews](https://soundcloud.com/vwoo/stablegains-customer-interviews) I conducted with the victims.
