title: Even More On Lambda School

Against my better judgment, and almost two years after my original reporting, I returned to the story of Lambda School once more. In the intervening time, the school had gone through many changes, most of which seemed to be for the worse. Subsequently to my reporting, the school changed its name to the "Bloom Institute of Technology."

Here are some artifacts from this go-around:

* The [kickoff piece in Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10), which uses leaked documents and student testimony to paint a portrait of a struggling school.
* A [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/fulligin/status/1460420173123313666) wherein I scoop that the school was about to change its name and tuition financing model.
* Another piece for Business Insider about [general bootcamp accounting fraud and tips for prospective students](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-coding-bootcamps-2021-11).
* An appearance on [TechCrunch's Equity podcast](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/the-inherent-tensions-within-venture-capital/) wherein we opine about the structural reasons for outcomes like Lambda School's.
