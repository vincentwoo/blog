I made this visualization of a
[violin and piano performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjZOL4C0oVo)
a year or so ago in Adobe After Effects and then promptly forgot about it.


It was inspired by this [very similar and honestly much better video][1].
I think I'll play with attempting to get actually separate instrument tracks
instead of trying to muddle with frequency filters to try to split them.
