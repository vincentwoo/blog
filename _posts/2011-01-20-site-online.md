So I guess I'm finished with this mostly minimal layout paired with an
incredibly minimal [rack stack](http://cloudhead.io/toto) running for
dirt, dirt free on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/). I've also put
together a [resume](/static/resume.pdf) that's current as of the writing of
this post. It's lovingly hand crafted in inDesign and the typeface is
[ITC Avant Garde Gothic Pro][1]. Credits to team [TFNY][2] for consultation
on both.
