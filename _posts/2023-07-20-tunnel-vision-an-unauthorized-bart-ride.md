After 6 months of on-and-off-again labor, I released a feature-length film composed mostly of footage obtained by attaching
a camera to the front of a BART train.

You can [watch the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Jrp6it9Ss) in its entirety for free on YouTube, as well as the
[impromptu panel Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5KQl7693TU) I hosted at the [Roxie](https://roxie.com/) premiere.
The Roxie is an important San Francisco nonprofit theater and I want to thank them again for showing my film.

Also, if you've ever been stuck in a Zoom meeting and wished you were on BART instead, I have a few fun looping Zoom
backgrounds you can use:

* [Transbay Tube](https://storage.googleapis.com/tunnelvision/transbay_tube_zoom_background.mp4) (230mb, 3:56)
* [19th St. to Rockridge](https://storage.googleapis.com/tunnelvision/19th_to_rockridge_zoom_background.mp4) (383mb, 6:33)
* [Walnut Creek to Pleasant Hill](https://storage.googleapis.com/tunnelvision/walnut_creek_to_pleasant_hill_zoom_background.mp4) (261mb, 4:33)

Look at all the fun you can have!
