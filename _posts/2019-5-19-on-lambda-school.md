I recently concluded some investigative reporting on Lambda School, which basically accused the school and its chief officer of fraud. I won't bother to summarize these claims here. Instead, I'll just link to the artifacts this investigation produced:

* The original piece, which ran in [New York Magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html).
* The [audio recording](https://soundcloud.com/vwoo/interview-with-austen-allred) of the interview I conducted with Austen Allred, their chief executive.
* An [interview I gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hUT8VZNvm8) on This Week In Startups, in response to criticism of my piece on a previous episode of TWiS by the host of the show and Austen Allred.
