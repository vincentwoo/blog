# Summary

San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin is back in the news, [proposing legislation][1] with the ostensible purpose of preserving rent controlled apartments by preventing them from being converted into "monster" homes. His legislation requires that anyone who wants to change pretty much anything about a piece of property acquire a conditional use permit from the Planning Department. Disregarding the fact that this is obviously a bill designed to lengthen San Francisco's already byzantine permitting process, _Aaron Peskin is personally guilty of the very crime he seeks to prevent_.

In 2002, newly elected Supervisor Aaron Peskin arranged a remarkable sweetheart deal on his current home, [224 Filbert Street][2], a duplex in Telegraph Hill. After preventing the previous owner from converting this duplex into a single family home, Peskin acquired the property for half of what the previous owner paid. He continues to use it for the very purpose he previously objected to: a single family home.

This is the strange, ridiculous story of how Peskin came to live in a monster home that used to be a rent-controlled duplex.

# Timeline

- Oct. 2000: A wealthy San Francisco investment advisor named William Brady purchases the 224 Filbert property for $1.5M. Brady then sells to the property to Joanne Trafton for $1.5M, three weeks later. Trafton is the owner of several other nearby Telegraph Hill properties.

- Nov. 2000: Peskin wins the election for District 3 amid a crowded field of contenders.

- May 2001: Trafton receives a permit to perform a [\$25,000 kitchen renovation](http://dbiweb.sfgov.org/dbipts/default.aspx?page=Permit&PermitNumber=200105219674&Stepin=1) of 224 Filbert. Around the same time of the ostensible kitchen renovation, she also illegally performs work to merge the two units of the duplex by removing the kitchen in one unit and adding an internal staircase.

- Oct. 2001: Trafton applies for a permit to retroactively legitimize having merged the property into a single family home. The Telegraph Hill Dwellers (THD), a large neighborhood association that Peskin was the president of until his election, sends [a letter][3] opposing the merger.

  Simultaneously, Planning staff recommends that the Planning Commission exercise its discretionary review powers to deny the merger. Trafton, defeated, [withdraws her application][6].

- Dec. 2002: Trafton [sells the duplex to Peskin's parents][4] for $800,000 â€” a $700,000 loss on the \$1.5M she paid two years earlier.

- Dec. 2002: Peskin's parents begin transferring ownership of the property to Peskin and his wife. This continued gradually and eventually concluded in April of 2007, with Aaron Peskin and his wife owning 100% of the property free and clear.

- Oct. 2004: An unnamed complainant (likely a neighbor) [lodges a complaint][7] with the Department of Building Inspection that the property has been illegally merged. This complaint is abated by DBI.

# Analysis

When Trafton acquired 224 Filbert in 2001, she paid $1.5M for roughly 1500 sqft of real estate, or approximately $1000 per sqft. At the time, this was a very large amount to pay for an older duplex of two small one-bedroom units. However, a single-family home of the same size could plausible go for \$1.5M, and would retain its value better than the two individual units. It is likely that Trafton planned her conversion from the outset.

A big part of this case rests on information discovered during the [discretionary review][8] regarding the merger. According to this document, Trafton performed renovations and illegally merged the duplex before filing with the city to formally acknowledge the property as a single family home. The smoking gun in the report is a photo of a newly-built internal staircase connecting the two units. Here's a current photo of the staircase, which I took while on a recent stroll through Telegraph Hill:

Aaron Peskin's wife, Nancy Shanahan, had already paid the city to receive advance notice of any permit applications for 224 Filbert. Shanahan serves on the Telegraph Hill Dwellers board as of the writing of this piece, and Peskin was board president for several years before his election. After discovering (likely through Nancy) that Trafton was filing for her permits, the THD wrote a letter to support Planning's recommendation to deny the merger. My point with all of this is that there is no plausible way that the Peskins could have been ignorant of the illegal merger aspect of 224 Filbert. It even looks like it is fairly likely that they themselves are responsible for galvanizing the official opposition to the merger.

In the face of the organized opposition from both Planning and the Supervisor of the neighborhood, Trafton withdrew her application. Because Trafton withdrew her application instead of continuing her discretionary review, she was not required to acquire permits to return the building to its original condition as a duplex. Trafton was left in a difficult position. She had purchased the property for \$1.5M, but now had no way of selling the property for that much as a single family home. She also could not sell it as a duplex just to recoup some of her losses without performing additional work to undo her merger.

I, of course, cannot be privy to whatever discussions she had with Aaron Peskin, but she resolved to sell the property to Peskin's parents for half of what she had paid. It is likely that this was a matter of convenience for her - it allowed her to get rid of what was becoming a toxic asset quickly and quietly. Even though the sale price was half of what she had paid, she wouldn't have to bother with additional construction work to restore the property to a duplex. This deal, of course, is an astounding act of corruption and conflict of interest.

It is important to state, once again, that this home is absolutely not a duplex. Disregarding the still visible internal staircase, if the home was still a duplex, one would imagine that Peskin was residing in one of the two units and renting out the other. Peskin is required to report his income as an elected official, but no such income from the rental of the other 224 Filbert "unit" has been disclosed, though he has disclosed income from his other rental properties.

Two years after Peskin acquired the property, the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) received a complaint that the building had been merged. Facing this complaint, Peskin very quickly applied for permits to ameliorate DBI's concerns. He managed to complete the permitting process in an astoundingly fast time: one day (most take months).

Ironically, the permit page lists the building very clearly as a "2 FAMILY DWELLING". Strangely, though, this permit mentions only renewing older permits, and not undoing an illegal merger. Even more strangely, despite that, DBI [closed its case][7] on the complaint a few days later. I have no explanation for why this happened, as DBI did not take any detailed notes on how this case was handled that I could discover. It seems fairly likely that Peskin pulled some strings to get the complaint to go away quietly.

# This matters

To reiterate, there is no version of events where Peskin innocently acquired a home that he didn't know used to be a duplex. The fight over whether Trafton would be allowed to legitimize her merger happened only a year before he bought the house from her, and he and his wife were essentially the other side of that fight. There is no world where Peskin is conveniently unaware that his home used to be a duplex, _because the city still says that it is a duplex on every current record and form related to the property_.

There's a simple case to be made that Peskin's actions constitute the crime of graft (or extortion). Peskin blocked Trafton's merger of 224 Filbert and then subsequently occupied it as a merged home. By secretly profiting from the very thing he purported to oppose, Peskin turned his $800,000 home into something worth much more. Taking Trafton's purchase price at face value, a merged 224 Filbert was worth at least $1.5M. Essentially, Peskin's use of his power in Telegraph Hill netted him at least \$700,000. This transaction's very existence is at minimum a clear conflict of interest and more likely an abuse of the power of office for personal profit.

Even more shocking, though, is how he could pen an entire bill that uses as its bogeyman the very home he lives in. His 70 page proposal's ostensible reason for existence is the protection of rent controlled apartments. One wonders how much of the bill he wrote in his stolen rent controlled apartments, or if he felt even a glimmer of guilt while he wrote it.
