In November of last year, I was invited to give a fairly informal talk on the
topic of my choice at Dropbox. I decided to go with the mildly controversial
topic of advocating Dropbox employees to consider making side businesses.
They were gracious enough to furnish me with a recording of the talk, which you
may also enjoy below. It's got a few nuggets about how I think about running a
small business and some mistakes you probably want to avoid making.
