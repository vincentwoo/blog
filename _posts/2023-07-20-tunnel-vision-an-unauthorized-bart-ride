After 6 months of on-and-off-again labor, I released a feature-length film composed mostly of footage obtained by attaching
a camera to the front of a BART train.

You can [watch the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Jrp6it9Ss) in its entirety for free on YouTube, as well as the
[impromptu panel Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5KQl7693TU) I hosted at the [Roxie](https://roxie.com/) premiere.
The Roxie is an important San Francisco nonprofit theater and I want to thank them again for showing my film.
